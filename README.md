# cs32-proj-4
Contains my solutions to Project 4 of Winter '16 CS32 at UCLA. In this project, we created an interface to store and access large amounts of web history data on hard drive memory using a hash table, and then search through the large amounts of data to find connections between malicious entities. The specification can be found at: http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs32/Projects/4/spec.html.
